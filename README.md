### 📁 Directory Structure

* `/` – Root directory. The top of the directory tree.
* `/bin` – Essential **binary** executables (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) needed for system booting and single-user mode.
* `/etc` – System **configuration files** (e.g., network, user accounts, services).
* `/home` – **User home directories**, e.g., `/home/alex`. Each user stores personal files and settings here.
* `/opt` – **Optional or third-party software** packages (e.g., proprietary software, add-ons).
* `/tmp` – **Temporary files**. Cleared on reboot. Often used by programs during execution.
* `/usr` – **User-related programs** and data. Contains read-only user utilities and applications (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, etc.).
